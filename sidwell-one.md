*Reading Medieval Latin*: Education

Note - adding lots of etymological notes for words I don't know / aren't in dictionaries

Notes
- Roman education sought to produce speakers, even under the empire where upper class elite who attended rhetorical schools had less power. 
- In 5th century, the seven liberal arts were set as the basis for the new curriculum: Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric (later called the *Trivium*), and Music, Arithmetic, Geometry, and Philosophy (or Astronomy (*Quadrivium*)). 
- a child would enter a monastery as an oblate (= having not professed vows) at seven. He would begin by learning Latin, singing (cantus), and calculation (computus). The first texts he would learn would be the Psalms, doubling as a chant textbook. The computus was not only an introduction to arithmetic, but also taught the study of time and the annual and liturgical calendars. Following this was an intensive study of grammatica to help learn Latin grammar. Fluency in Latin was also aided by puzzles, jokes, set speeches and dialogues. \
- Monasteries of course were major centers of learning, mostly focused on study of Scripture, Church Fathers, church matters, and to a lesser degree pagan classical texts. 
- Early on, monastic communities formed rules to keep order as they emerged as self-sufficient centers of learning. Some include the Rule of Pachomius (translated into Latin by Jerome - first written rule), Augustine's Letter 211 (used later as basis of Rule of St. Augustine), and the Regula magistri (Rule of the Master). The last was the basis for Benedict's rule, the most influential (c. 530-60). 
- Benedict's birth is dated around 480 traditionally and his birthplace was Nursia, ~60 miles north-east of Rome. His life coincided with wars fought by Justinian against the Ostrogothic rulers of the West. Nothing is known of Benedict except what Gregory the Great records in the 2nd book of his Dialogues, revealing him as the head of several monastic communities, and elsewhere quoting the Rule. 

Some vulgarisms can be seen in Benedict's Rule, along with the one attributed to Isidore
- _comparare_ instead of _emere_ (= _to buy_)
- _meminere_ instead of _meminisse_ (= _to remember_)
- _paruissimus_ instead of _minimus_ (= _smallest_)
- _ab Idus_ for _ab Idibus_ (= _from the Ides_)
- use of nom/acc instead of ablative absolute

**1(a) St Benedict's Rule _(Benedicti Regula)_**

Benedict enunciates the rules governing reading at meals, which are to be done by a weekly reader to a silent refectory (refectory = room for eating meals).

_XXXVIII De Ebdomadario_ [1] _Lectore_ **38: On the Weekly Reader**

1. Reading should not be lacking for the tables of the brothers, [2] and let not anyone accidentally seize the book to read there, but let the one going to read for the whole week advance on Sunday.
2. Who (= the reader) proceeding after masses and communion, let him seek from all that it be prayed for him (= that prayers be said for him), in order that God might remove from him the spirit of elation (=pride). 
3. And let this verse be said in the third prayer by all, however with him beginning, "Lord, you will open (future _aperies_, but read as imperative =open) my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise.
4. And with the blessing having been received in this way, let him advance for the purpose of reading.
5. And let there be greatest silence, so that the murmuring [3] or voice of no one, except only of the one reading, may be heard there. 
6. The things which truly are necessary in eating and drinking, in this way let the brothers minister to one another, so that no one should need to ask for anything.
7. If there is any work however, by the sound [4] of some sign let it be sought rather than by voice. 
8. And let not anyone there presume regarding the reading or to inquire about anyting else, lest occasion be given,
9. unless by chance the Prior wishes for the sake of instruction [5] to briefly say something. 
10. And let the lector brother of the week receive a small portion of bread and wine (= a mixtum), before he begins to read, for the sake of holy communion [6] and lest the fast perhaps be hard for him to sustain.
11. And afterwards let him refresh himself with the weekly cook and servants.
12. And let the brothers not by order (or rank?) read or sing, but only those who edify [5] those listening. 


[1] _ebdomadario_ = _hebdomadāriō_, abl. of _hebdomadārius, -i_ which just comes from _hebdomas_ (7 in Greek :D) meaning week

[2] here nec is really et ne for some reason.

[3] _musitatio_ = murmuring

[4] not a literal sound, perhaps some kind of sign language?

[5] aedificatione = edification, literally building up

[6] gloss explains this as so that he doesn't accidentally commit irreverence (such as throwing up the host) if he reads without ingesting anything after mass


**1(b) The Rule of St. Isidore**

Rules for the borrowing and return of books, the asking of questions and forbidden reading.

_De Codicibus_ **On Books**

1. Let him assign all books a guardian of the sacrarium, from whom every brother may receive each, which, having been read wisely and (properly) looked after, let them always return after Vespers. And on the first hour let them ask for books for each day; he who in truth demans more tardy (maybe asking for beyond a day), by no means let him receive.
2. And regarding those inquiries, which are read, and not perhaps understood, each one of the brothers either in supper or after vespers let him ask the abbot, and, with it (= the quaestio) having been read in the reading place, let him receive an explanation from him, in this manner so that, while it is being explained by one, the others may listen. 
3. Let the monk beware against reading the books of the Gentiles or the volumes of the heretics; for it is better to not know their harmful teachings, than to fall into errors through a trial in some snare.


**2. Cassiodorus, _Institutiones_**
