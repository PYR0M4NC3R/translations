This will just include random stuff on common words and grammar, etc.


### Prepositions, conjunctions, common adverbs etc.
copying this list straight from a dictionary

#### Prepositions
**a (ab, abs)** _(prep. + abl.)_ from, away from

**ad** _(prep. + acc.)_ to, toward; for (the purpose of); at

**coram** _(prep + abl.)_ in the presence of

**cum** _(prep + abl.)_ with

**de** _(prep + abl)_ from, down from; about, concerning;

**e (ex)** _(prep + abl)_ from, out of

**in** _(prep + acc)_ into, onto; against; for (the purpose of); _(prep + abl)_ in, on; among; by means of, with

**pro** _(prep + abl)_ in front of; in behalf of, for; instead of, on behalf of

**sine** _(prep + abl)_ without

**super** _(prep + acc)_ above, upon; over _(prep + abl)_ about, concerning

**trans** _(prep + acc)_ across

#### Adjectives governing ablative
dignus = worthy of (abl)

plenus = full of (abl) - example gratia plena in the Ave Maria, plena agrees with Maria and governs ablative gratia.


#### Adverbs
**hodie** _(adv)_ today

**hic** _(adv)_ here

**ibi** _(adv)_ there

**adhuc** _(adv)_ till now, so far

#### Conjunctions
**nam** _(coord. conj)_ for

### Random notes on grammar
- all second declension nouns ending in -er or -ir are masculine. the majority of 2nd decl ending in -us are masculine

Future - s:(ero, eris, erit) p:(erimus, eritis, erunt)

#### Dative of Possessor
The thing possessed is in the nominative, and the possessor is in the dative, with form of sum. Similar to Gk.

**agri sunt viro** = the fields are to the man = the man has the fields

Note, usually when Dat of Pos. is used, it's to highlight the fact of the possession - whereas gen. of possession usually is just an ancillary piece of a sentence. 


#### Time/aspect of verbs


| | Simple | Progressive | Completed |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Present | Present | Present | Present |
| Past | Perfect | Imperfect | Pluperfect |
| Future | Future | Future | Future Perfect |
